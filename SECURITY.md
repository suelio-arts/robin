# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest tagged release and the `main` branch.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately by opening a GitHub security advisory for this repository when available. If advisories are not enabled, email **info@robinreview.dev**.

Do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities that could expose secrets, private repository contents, or allow untrusted users to trigger paid LLM usage.

## Security Notes

Robin sends pull request diffs to the LLM endpoint configured by the repository owner. Review your provider's data retention policy before using hosted APIs on private code.

Recommended workflow practices:

- Use GitHub Secrets for API keys.
- Keep workflow permissions minimal: `contents: read` and `pull-requests: write`.
- `pull_request_target` is supported only for the API-only review path. Never
  add checkout or execution of pull-request code to that trusted workflow.
- Keep slash commands maintainer-only with `min-command-permission: "write"` unless you understand the cost and privacy tradeoffs.
- Gate `issue_comment` jobs by trusted `author_association` in workflow `if` conditions to avoid starting jobs for untrusted comments.
- Pin this action to `@main` (supported default) or an immutable commit SHA. Do not use `@v0` — it is outdated and breaks consumer workflows.
- Set a job-level `timeout-minutes` such as `15` to cap runner usage if a provider or network call hangs.
- Prefer self-hosted runners and private model endpoints for sensitive codebases.
